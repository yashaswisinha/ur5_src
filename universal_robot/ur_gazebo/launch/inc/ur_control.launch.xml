    This file 'pretends' to load a driver for a UR robot, by accepting similar
    arguments and playing a similar role (ie: starting the driver node (in this
    case Gazebo) and loading the ros_control controllers).

    Some of the arguments to this .launch file will be familiar to those using
    the ur_robot_driver with their robot.

    Other parameters are specific to Gazebo.

    Note: we spawn and start the ros_control controllers here, as they are,
    together with gazebo_ros_control, essentially the replacement for the
    driver which would be used with a real robot.
